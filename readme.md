1、todo: implement ecs with deno and use decorator to make ecs can be serialize and deserialize perfectly: 
1. copy ecs from ET project
1. transfer just json/bson between process and just use string as mid data to `serialize to` / `be deserialize`

2、todo: location sender`[as an actor]` should get the result of request. so it can known if the actor valid or not.
